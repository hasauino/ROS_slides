# ROS Slides
These are a set of slides I made in the past to introduce ROS.

- :file_folder: extended: slides I used at HBRS university during the foundation course. They cover ROS API in Python (important topics) and intended to be covered in **~15 hrs**.
- :file_folder: short: is for a workshop of **3 hrs** giving an overview of ROS



:warning: I don't own the right for the Latex theme used to create the slides. It is the theme used at HBRS university.
